## Description

Course description: "This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page." 

For this project I used the [starter HTML and CSS files](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) provided by Udacity and transformed this static page into an interactive one. All Javascript is written by me, and I've also made small changes to the CSS and HTML files.
